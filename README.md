# AlphaZeroNano

AlphaZeroNano is a miniature implementation of the famous AlphaZero, designed to understand and master grid-based board games. This project offers a lightweight framework for exploring the principles behind deep reinforcement learning combined with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in the context of board games.
